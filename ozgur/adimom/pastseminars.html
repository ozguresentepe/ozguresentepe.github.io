<b>Title</b>:The geometry of the visual cortex: Contact structures and Gabor expansions
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>:Since Hubel and Wiesel discovered the modular structure of the visual cortex, the part of our brain which is responsible for the interpretation of visual stimuli, the problem of a theoretical understanding of the experimental data on what is known as geometrical architecture of the visual brain, has emerged. The geometry of interest is not the anatomical geometry of the brain but the differential geometry of the connectivity between neural cells. The purpose of this talk is to present how the neurons of the visual cortex behave as a fiber bundle equipped with a contact structure as well as functions used in non-orthogonal series expansions of signals. Can these two models be combined to give interesting results for mathematicians and neuroscientists?

<b>Title</b>:Concepts in Chemical Symmetry
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>:Don't worry, this chemistry talk will have 0 (ok maybe 1 or 2 I can't help myself) molecular structures or even chemical names. Instead, I will focus on handwaving my way through a Chemist's use of Symmetry, and in particular the Chemist's superficial understanding and utility of Group Theory concepts. At the end, possibly after a standing ovation, I will discuss Asymmetry, and time permitting the field of Asymmetric Catalysis, which I have been pretending to study the past 4 years (with limited success).

<b>Title</b>:Surface group representations and AdS 3-manifolds
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: Associated to any (finite type) hyperbolic surface is the Teichm&uuml;ller space of marked hyperbolic metrics on that surface. It turns out that this identifies with a special space of representations of the fundamental group into PSL(2,R) (mod conjugation). An aim of Higher Teichm&uuml;ller theory is to associate more general "geometric structures" to certain representations into Lie groups. 

An Anti-de Sitter (AdS) 3-manifold is a Lorentzian 3-manifold of constant curvature -1. In this talk, we will discuss some recent results on AdS 3-manifolds that fit into the Higher Teichm&uuml;ller framework.

<b>Date</b>:April 3, 2021
<br>
<b>Title</b>:Finite Topological Spaces
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>:I was initially interested in finite topological spaces for several reasons:
- a characterization of spectra of commutative rings as limits of finite T_0-spaces
- a testing ground for understanding convolution algebras
- simple examples of non-Haudsdorff spaces

Currently I can't really build a talk out of any of the three things above, so my plan is to explain the basics of homotopy theory of finite spaces and explain how this is applied to algebraic topology and finite group theory.

<b>Abstract</b>:Kloosterman sums are a certain kind of trigonometric sums appearing in many problems of number theory.

<b>Title</b>:Minimal subfield of elliptic curves of number fields
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>:The concept of minimal subfields of an elliptic curve defined over a number field was introduced by Murty and Akbary in 2001. This talk will be an exposition of their paper. Their work sits on the sweet intersection of Arithmetic geometry, Galois representation theory and L-functions. When I first read the paper I had little knowledge about those areas and yet the paper was very much accessible. So, I hope it will be the same for you.

<b>Title</b>:A New Generation of Mechanical Heart Valves
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>:Valvular heart disease is a cardiovascular condition characterized by damage to any number of the four valves within the human heart. As the disease progresses, the damage sustained can require the implantation of a prosthetic heart valve. One type of prosthetic valve is a mechanical heart valve, characterized by its near infinite lifespan and lifelong requirement of anticoagulation medication. We set out to design a new valve that addressed the inherent thrombogenicity of modern mechanical heart valves, eliminating the need for medication. The result was the Okanagan valve.

<b>Abstract</b>:he decomposition theorem (of Beilinson-Bernstein-Deligne-Gabber) is a very important tool in algebraic geometry. I plan to mention some of the techniques used in the topology of algebraic varieties (such as perverse sheaves, Lefschetz theorems etc), and then to explain how the decomposition theorem helps in this study.

<b>Title</b>: Curvature in metric geometry and General Relativity
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
I will review the notion of curvature in the setting of metric and semi-Riemannian geometry. Curvature is of fundamental importance in General Relativity (GR), where it relates the geometry with the matter-energy content of the space. Then I will describe some recent work which imports ideas and tools from metric geometry into GR, where it allows to treat spacetimes of low regularity (Lorentzian manifolds with a metric of regularity below C^{1,1}, i.e., the derivative exists and is locally Lipschitz continuous).

<b>Title</b>: Motivic integration in real algebraic geometry
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
Several recent results in real algebraic and analytic geometries rely
on arguments coming from motivic integration. These results concern
blow-Nash maps, real singularities via the blow-analytic and the
arc-analytic equivalences, and, more recently, inner-Lipschitz maps.

Similarly to the complex case, the real motivic measure assigns a
"volume" to some sets of real analytic arcs on a real algebraic
variety. However, it is not possible to use the complex construction
as it is because Chevalley's theorem and the Nullstellensatz do not
hold in this real context.

First I will explain the construction of this real motivic measure and
how to process the cited above issues. Then I will focus on an
application of this real motivic measure: an inverse mapping theorem
for blow-Nash maps (i.e. semialgebraic maps which become real analytic
after being composed with blowings-up). These maps recently played an
important role in real algebraic geometry and in the classification of
real singularities.

<b>Title</b>: Universality and randomness: the Gaussian and KPZ classes.
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
In this talk we will introduce the concept of universality from a probability point of view. We will try to explain what makes the Gaussian distribution universal, introduce the KPZ class and understand what makes it harder to prove universality in this class. The goal is to introduce most ideas, objects and techniques that will be discussed. Hopefully, the audience will be able to understand a couple more minutes in the next probability colloquium talk.

<b>Speaker</b>: Fedya Kogan
<br>
<b>Date</b>:  Saturday October 19, 2019
<br>
<b>Title</b>: Witnessing the Elephant
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
I will try to give an accessible introduction to Topos Theory. Topoi were initially defined by Grothendieck, while pursuing the notion of what is now known as etale cohomology, in order to generalize the notion of sheaves on a space. Soon after, Lawvere and Tierney noticed that topoi provide a suitable semantics, for a variety of logic systems, capable of replacing ZFC as a type-theory like foundation for mathematics. Together this results in topoi being a peculiar bridge between geometry and logic. I will try to illustrate the previous sentence by going over some topos theory basics, and then culminating in discussing independence results in set theory and the classifying topos of local rings.

<b>Speaker</b>: Artane Siad
<br>
<b>Date</b>:  Saturday September 28, 2019
<br>
<b>Title</b>: Class group statistics: stability and instability. 
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
The Cohen-Lenstra conjectures describe the distribution of class groups and related statistics as one varies over the collection of all number fields through a “stacky counting” heuristic. We will examine the questions of stability and instability of a particular statistic, the average number of non-trivial 2-torsion elements in the class group (*), when one “perturbs” the collection of all number fields. The talk will begin with a gentle introduction to stacky counting and the Cohen-Lenstra heuristic. We will then discuss the stability of statistic (*) in the 2 cases where Cohen-Lenstra has been proven and present new insight on the instability of (*) under so called “global” perturbations.

<b>Title</b>: Invariant random subgroups
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
Let G be a locally compact group. An invariant random subgroup (IRS) of G is a conjugation invariant Borel probability measure on the space of closed subgroups of G. They arise as stabilizers of probability measure preserving actions, and are a natural generalization of both normal subgroups and lattices in G. Thus, many people have tried to extend results about lattices and normal subgroups in the context of IRS: for example, nontrivial invariant random subgroups in rank 1 Lie groups are discrete, geometrically dense, and have growth rate more than half of that of a cocompact lattice. The space IRS(G) of invariant random subgroups of G is a compact G-space, studying which can provide new insight into generic properties of lattices in G, for instance when G is a simple Lie group. When G=SL_2R the space of invariant random subgroups contains moduli spaces of all hyperbolizable Riemann surfaces, and the associated compactifications is related to the Deligne-Mumford compactification. I will talk about these things.

<b>Title</b>: Topological semantics
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
Though topological semantics were the first semantics given for modal 
logic, for much of the history of modal logic, they have often been 
ignored in favor of Kripke semantics. For many approaches to modal 
logic, however, the topological semantics furnish a
 much more exciting landscape. In fact, given that one is interested in 
modal logics with certain assumptions, the topological semantics are 
provably more rich. In particular, epistemic logic, philosophy of 
science, and quantified modal logic have all recently
 benefited from a topological perspective.  I will introduce some common
 modal logics and motivate Kripke semantics with an epistemic logic 
puzzle demonstration. Then, we will prove a completeness result of 
everyone's favorite modal logic, S4. This result will
 be ported over to the topological world, where we can further prove 
some general results about logics of spaces. On the other hand, we will 
prove a specific result about Q, which, when coupled with the general 
results, will tell us that R, R^n, Cantor space,
 manifolds, CW-complexes, and probably some other stuff is all boring.

<b>Title</b>: The spectral rigidity of chaotic billiards
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
The question of dynamical spectral rigidity has been investigated in a range of settings: for hyperbolic surfaces, convex domains with symmetries... In a joint work with Péter Bálint, Jacopo De Simoi and Vadim Kaloshin, we study a class of dispersing billiards on the plane obtained by removing strictly convex obstacles satisfying the non-eclipse condition. In this case, there is a natural labelling of periodic orbits, and we want to know how much geometric
 information can be recovered from the Marked Length Spectrum, i.e., the set of lengths of periodic orbits together with their labelling. In particular, we show that for each period two orbit, the curvature at the two bouncing points can be reconstructed. We also show that the Lyapunov exponent of each periodic orbit can be recovered. Our approach is based on a sequence of periodic orbits with symmetries which shadow more and more closely some orbit homoclinic to the periodic orbit that we want to describe. In the case of period two orbits, we will explain how it is possible to extract some asymmetric information to distinguish between the two points in the orbit.

<b>Title</b>: The dynamics of protoplanetary disks and their influence on the formation of planetary systems
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
Before the discovery of planets outside our solar system, astronomers based our theories of how planets formed on the solar 
system planets. We predicted small rocky planets would form close to their host stars, while large gaseous planets would form 
far. The orbits of of the planets were expected to be circular, and orbit in the same direction as their host stars rotation. 
It came as a surprise to the astronomical community that the first planets discovered were massive planets on close-in or 
eccentric orbits orbiting in directions very different than their host star's rotation. In this talk, we will heuristically 
discuss the main ideas on how to form these strange planetary systems. We will also briefly mention the speaker's contribution 
to this field, looking at how gravitational interactions between disks of gas and dust orbiting young stars (protoplanetary 
disks) affect the planetary systems formed within these disks.

Quantum computing has been the source of much excitement in the last decade, promising exponential speed-up in computation of a 
handful of tricky problems. Though it is conjectured that the class of polynomial-time quantum-solvable problems (BQP) is 
larger than the class of polynomial-time classically solvable problems (P, BPP), it is not clear what resource properties of 
quantum computers quantify this speed-up.

In this talk I will provide a summary of “contextuality”, a current contender for the essential quantum resource that allows 
for faster computation. Further, in [1806.04657] myself and my collaborators demonstrate a connection between algebraic 
topology and contextuality. I will lay out this framework within certain models of quantum computation, and prove a few results 
that are of interest to understanding contextuality as the quantum resource.

<b>Title</b>: Generalized Brauer-Siegel Theorem
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
For a number field K/Q, the class number h_K  captures how far the ring of
integers of K is from being a PID. The study of class numbers is a theme in
number theory. In order to understand how the class number varies upon varying
the number field, Siegel showed that the class number times the regulator tends
to infinity in any sequence of quadratic number fields. Brauer extended this
result to sequence of Galois extensions over Q. This is the Brauer-Siegel
theorem. Recently, Tsfasman and Vladut conjectured a Brauer-Siegel statement for
asymptotically exact sequence of number fields. In this talk, we prove the
classical Brauer-Siegel and the generalized version in several unknown cases. We
also provide some effective versions of Brauer-Siegel in the classical setting.

<b>Abstract</b>: 
What happens when a mathematician, decides to talk about life and other
important things such as love, philosophy, sociology, politics and literature? I
believe the outcome would be interesting for other mathematicians as well! First
I try to address these 2 questions: why a person decides to become a
mathematician?(who was Unabomber? Is there a difference between Hardy’s and
Thurston’s way of Masaining(doing math!)) why so many math phd’s become
statistician and economists?(stat from math geneology project- why they don’t
become politicians instead(Cedric Villani + Angela Merkel = ??)). I also have a
theory, which is kind of the reason “I” ‘m (or am not going to) doing (do) math
(anymore). This theory is pretty much rooted in my background as an eastern
person, born in the specific time and location, and to a specific family. I
think it would be a bit understandable for the people with knowledge about the
eastern culture. In this theory I want to show how on one hand the government
tries to make “screws” for his machine and on the other hand, large companies
try to make their own “screws” and how no one cares for the beauty of twisting
anymore. I arrive at a triangle, on one vertex are engineers, on the other two
politicians and artists. And one of my main theses is to show how close the last
two are to each other. If time allows, I use this theory of mine and apply it to
the actual crisis that we have in our department and arrive at a solution.

<b>Abstract</b>: 
The definition of a vertex algebra was formulated by Borcherds in the 1980s to
solve algebraic problems, but these objects turn out to have important
applications in mathematical physics, especially related to models of 2d
conformal field theory. In the 1990s, Beilinson and Drinfeld gave geometric
formulations of the definition, which they called chiral algebras and
factorization algebras. These different approaches each have advantages and
disadvantages: for example, the definition of a vertex algebra is more concrete
and has so far been better studied; on the other hand, the geometric approach of
chiral algebras and factorization algebras allows for transfer of knowledge
between the fields of geometry, physics, and representation theory, and
furthermore admits natural generalizations to higher dimensions. In this talk we
will introduce all three of these objects; then we will discuss the
relationships between them, especially focusing on how information from any one
approach can lead to new understanding in the others. ​

<b>Title</b>: Reinforcement Learning
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with
optimal behavioural control. RL provides a normative framework in which to
understand how the brain can learn to make decisions for maximizing subjective
reward in the absence of an explicit teaching signal. Currently, even agents
using state-of-the-art control systems in RL tasks are data inefficient and
challenged by nonstationary environmental conditions, including changes in
statistics of reward probability and transitions between states, which
biological agents handle with relative ease. It has been proposed that storing
information about experienced episodes in a memory cache -- modeled after the
activity of the hippocampus in animals -- can help bootstrap learning in RL
systems to improve the speed of learning and ability to cope with nonstationary
environments. My research proposes three different representations for episodic
memories stored in such a system and aims to resolve which provides the greatest
benefit to RL systems when used in conjunction with a standard controller.
Furthermore I aim to resolve how these representations can account for features
of animal behaviour, and which of these representations -- if any -- are likely
to explain how episodic memory is represented in the hippocampus.

<b>Abstract</b>:
We describe homological-duality on manifolds-with-corners $(X, \del X)$, where
$X$ is a contractible space supporting a free $G$-action, with $G$ a
finitely-generated discrete matrix group.
<br>
Effectively computing $G$-equivariant (co)homology on $X$ is expensive process,
which is burdened by the fact that (!): the apparent space dimension $dim[X]$ is
typically much larger than the algebraic symmetry dimension $vcd[G]$ of the
symmetry group $G$. This observation originates with Borel-Serre from ~1980s in
their <Corners and Arithmetic Groups> paper, and leads to interesting ideas.
<br>
Our goal is to describe explicit $G$-equivariant subvarieties $Z$ of $X$, whose
topological dimension coincides with the symmetry dimension. We display the
subvarieties $Z$ as ``Kantorovich Singularities" of an optimal semicoupling
measure, with respect to a (gated)-electron-cost. The Kantorovich duality
principle underyling mass transport methods is, we
claim, the fundamental fact responsible for poincare duality. Attendees can

<b>Abstract</b>: To construct and classify G-bundles on the projective line, one
can cut the line into two disks and use an element of the loop group to glue
trivial bundles on each disk. By accounting for automorphisms of the bundles on
each disk, we get a presentation of moduli of G-bundles on the line in terms of
double cosets of the loop group. Surprisingly, a similar double coset
construction exists for moduli of G-bundles on any compact Riemann
surface---this is the content of the uniformization theorems of Beauville-Laszlo
and Laszlo-Sorger. These presentations allow one to relate certain 'strange'
induced representations of the loop group to vector bundles on the moduli
spaces, which leads to the study of conformal blocks.

<b>Abstract</b>: The action of a Lie group G on a manifold M is said to be of
cohomogeneity one if the orbit space M/G is a 1-manifold; such actions are
arguably the simplest after the transitive, and accordingly have been long
discussed and also classified in low dimensions. In this talk, we compute the
equivariant K-theory and Borel equivariant cohomology rings $K^*_G M$ and
$H^*_G(M;\mathbb Q)$ of such actions. 

The proof follows readily from a result of potentially much wider interest,
namely the existence of an additional algebraic structure on the Mayer-Vietoris
sequence for any multiplicative cohomology theory which, though easily stated
and simply demonstrated, has-as best we can tell-nevertheless escaped mention in
introductory topology texts.

- Take a bunch of unit squares in a complex plane and glue them along their
opposite sides so that they form a closed surface. You will obtain a Riemann
surface, a point in the moduli space of complex structures. Can you obtain any
complex structure via such construction? What if you slightly generalize and
start with a bunch of polygons instead of squares?

- Take your favorite matrix from SL(2,Z) and apply it to that bunch of unit
squares in the plane remembering the identification you chose. What kind of
surface do you get? Do you ever get the same thing? (spoiler: very often you
do!)

These questions come from the area called 'dynamics on the moduli space’ or
'translation surfaces'. It allows another view on the moduli space of curves as
polygons in the plane. There is an action of GL(2,R) on that space and there is
a rich study of the orbits of that action as they provide subvarieties of M_g.

<b>Abstract</b>:A starting point of algebraic geometry is the study of
varieties, zero sets of polynomial equations. In general, a variety $ X $ may
have singular points where information on the geometry of $ X $ is hidden. In
order to understand this situation better one tries to find a model $ Y $ of $ X
$ which shares many properties with $ X $, but which is easier to handle. One
approach is to resolve the singularities. In 1964, Hironaka has proven the
existence of such a model for varieties over fields of characteristic zero. The
aim of this talk is to give a gentle introduction to resolution of singularities
over the complex numbers. By discussing some examples, we will explore together
the ideas and techniques developed from Hironaka's famous proof. If time

<b>Title</b>: Toric varieties, log Calabi-Yau's, and Combinatorial
Representation Theory
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>:
Roughly speaking, a log Calabi-Yau is a space that comes equipped with a volume
form in a natural way. Let X be an affine log CY with volume form Ω. We can
partially compactify X by adding divisors along which Ω has a pole. The set of
these divisors says a lot about X's geometry-- for a torus (the simplest example
of a log CY) this set is just the cocharacter lattice. We can actually give this
set a geometrically motivated multiplication rule too, which I hope not to get
into. But this multiplication rule allows us to construct an algebra A, defined
purely in terms of the geometry of X, and conjecturally A is the algebra of
regular functions on the mirror to X. Viewed as a vector space, A naturally
comes with a basis-- the divisors we used to define it. So we get a canonical
basis for the space of regular functions on X's mirror. All of the technology
involved is a souped-up version of something from the world of toric varieties.
I'll describe the picture for toric varieties first, then say how this fits into
the broader log CY setting. Finally, many objects of interest to representation
theorists (semi-simple groups, flag varieties, Grassmannians...) are nice
partial compactifications of log CY's. This gives us a chance to use the
machinery of log CY mirror symmetry to get results in rep theory. Maybe the most
obvious application given what I've said so far is finding a canonical basis for
irreducible representations of a group. I'll discuss this, as well as how this
machinery reproduces cones that make combinatorial rep theorists feel warm and
fuzzy inside (like the Gelfand-Tsetlin cone and the Knutson-Tao hive cone).

<b>Abstract</b>:
A Dirac structure is a lagrangian subalgebroid in a Lie bialgebroid. One should

governing deformation theory of the Dirac.
The plan of the talk is to start with defining the relevant notions of Dirac
geometry and motivate the problem. Then I will give the necessary background on
L infinity algebras. Then I will try to explain our construction. Based on the
audience demand, the plan can be modified as we go, or abandoned altogether. No
background in Dirac geometry or L infinity algebras will be assumed.

<b>Title</b>: Geometric Invariant Theory
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>:
GIT is a way to study the equivariant geometry of varieties or schemes
(especially in the projective case). A popular application of GIT is in the
construction of coarse moduli spaces. In this context, GIT is a good tool for
providing compactifications of such spaces. Unfortunately, it is often the case
that the boundary of such a compactification has a "weaker modular meaning". One
may partially resolve the singularities of a GIT quotient and provide an
alternative compactification of these moduli spaces with better modular
properties. In the GIT language: it's a resolution that turns all semi-stable
points into either properly stable or unstable.

<b>Title</b>: The wonderful compactification for quantum groups
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>:
The wonderful compactification of a semisimple group links the geometry of the
group to the geometry of its partial flag varieties, encodes the asymptotics of
matrix coefficients for the group, and captures the rational degenerations of
the group. It plays a crucial role in several areas of geometric representation
theory, and can be realized as a quotient of the Vinberg semigroup. In this
talk, we will review several constructions of the wonderful compactification and
its relevant properties. We then introduce quantum group versions of the Vinberg
semigroup, the wonderful compactification, and the latter's stratification by G
x G orbits. The talk will include an overview of necessary background from the
representation theory of reductive groups, and a discussion of noncommutative
projective geometry.

<b>Title</b>: Laurence Sterne and Soviet Literary Scholars of the 1930s
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>:
We will explore the reception of Laurence Sterne's novels in Stalin's Russia in
the 1930s. In that tragic time of executions, arrests and the suppression of
free thought an interesting and paradoxical discussion about the personality and
works of the English comic author took place. The analysis is based both on
published texts and archival materials: unpublished articles about Sterne,
personal letters and documents of literary scholars of the 1930s.

<b>Title</b>: Some Motivation for Geometric Representation Theory

<b>Abstract</b>:
We'll reveal the why and how of the flag variety: where it comes from,
and how it's used. On the how end, we'll recite a handful of fancy
dualities, including, you guessed it, Howe duality. Examples may be
ramped up from sl_2 to sl_3, though always over C.

<b>Abstract</b>:
I will give an informal review of the theory of integrable systems from the
point of view of algebraic geometry. In particular, I will prove a classical
result saying that integrable systems could be linearized on the Jacobian of the
spectral curve. The talk will be based on simple (nevertheless,quite general)
examples.

<b>Title</b>: Some Motivation for Noncommutative Algebraic Geometry
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>:
In the classical theory of algebraic geometry, there is a very nice
correspondence between certain points on certain topological spaces and certain
ideals of certain rings. Similarly, in representation theory, there is a very
nice correspondence between certain ideals of certain rings and certain modules
over those rings. Then, certain French mathematicians in certain decades of last
century said that we should change our understanding of spaces and they
introduced sheaves, and they established yet another correspondence between
certain sheaves and certain of modules. This all happened in the commutative
case. I will talk about what happens in noncommutative algebra and how certain
modules act like points of certain so called noncommutative spaces.

Moduli spaces is a roughly 100 years old concept that changed the way
mathematicians think. We will explore various significance of moduli spaces as
families and will focus on examples. Examples will mainly be from algebraic
geometry.

<b>Title</b>: Knots, Links and 3-manifolds
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>:
This semester I was trying to get closer to such objects as knots, links and
3-manifolds. Various people were telling me interesting stories and I want to
share some of them with you. My talk will be rather an amateur bus trip (if you
know what I mean) by the colorful sights of topological wonders rather than a
deep investigation of the topic. In particular, we will perform a dance with
Seifert surfaces and make a surgery of the trefoil knot complement in the
3-sphere to extract its Alexander polynomial - a powerful invariant of knots and
links. We will see how Thurston norm on the homologies of 3-manifolds, a younger
sibling of Alexander polynomial, keeps record of all fibrations of this manifold
over the circle.
<br>
And here are some questions you might want to bring to our trip:
<br>
Is there a foliation of a 3-sphere by smooth surfaces?
<br>
Why figure-8 knot complement is a hyperbolic 3-manifold?
<br>
Can you visualize a circle bundle over a torus with Chern class equal to 1?

I will present the one of the most basic interactions of Representation Theory

<b>Title</b>:  McKay Correspondence
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>:
The McKay correspondence describes a relationship between resolution of Kleinian
singularities and representation theory of finite subgroups of SU(2, C). It gave
rise to many interesting questions and results linking resolution of
singularity, Auslander-Reiten theory and representation theory of algebras, as
well as string theory, amoung others. In this talk, we will describe the
correspondence and show some of its nice consequences. We will try to give an
historical account, starting with some work of Plato and DaVinci.

<b>Title</b>:  q-Homotopy for Simplicial Complexes
<br>
<b>Abstract</b>:
In the 1970s R.H. Atkin developed tools for studying connectivity properties of
simplicial complexes in a series of strange papers. The resulting theory of
q-connectedness was applied in many novel contexts but has since fallen in to
disuse. The theory has been entirely neglected by topologists (perhaps because
it was invented by a physicist and it is not a homeomorphism invariant). This
talk will introduce the modern treatment of q-connectedness as a homotopy theory
for combinatorial simplicial complexes. We'll apply it by computing some weird
groups related to the Platonic solids and, time permitting, some buildings.
