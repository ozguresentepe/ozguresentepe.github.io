## About

I am an EPSRC Research Fellow at the University of Leeds within the [representation theory group](https://sites.google.com/view/crt-leeds/). Previously, I was a postdoc at the University of Connecticut and I received my PhD from the University of Toronto under the supervision of Ragnar-Olaf Buchweitz. There I was a member of the Homological Methods Seminar and it shaped my research interests: representation theory, commutative algebra, homological algebra etc. After Ragnar passed away, I started working with Graham Leuschke while staying officially as a graduate student at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Joel Kamnitzer. I am an organizer of [UCGEN](https://sntp.notion.site/UCGEN-0d93f673b8a946e68bfe8120c30b0221) and I used to live at AdIMOM. My email address is o\[dot]esentepe\[at]leeds\[dot]ac\[dot]uk
